# nf2hack
Data Art project for the NF2 Hackathon in San Francisco

* For the [AI Genomics Hackathon](https://sv.ai/hackathon), I decided to take a different track and work on some data art with the data set provided.

* Code is written in Python. Libraries: Biopython, Python Image Library

I've been posting my progress on my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/posts/genomicart-step-12087837), and sharing screenshots of my work-in-progress. It may be more current than this repo.
